Possible refactors
------------------------------------

- Some ambiguity exists at minute between "client" / "game" GUI elements / messages
  They are essentially the same.  I think client is mybe better than game as the
  server manager can send CommClientMessage's

- Refactor graphical names of Jogre GUI objects and objects which directly extend Swing objects

- remove logging and replaced with Log4J (mybe use existing logging class as a wrapper object?)
