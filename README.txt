open-source, online, real-time games engine and API programmed entirely in 
Java.

Using JOGRE is it is easy to create powerful multi-player games which people 
can join from anywhere in the world. JOGRE is designed to be an open source 
equivalent to popular gaming websites such as Yahoo! Games.

games. A user can then play a game such as chess which connects to a server. 
This user can then play against other users from around the world easily in 
real time. Users can create public tables where anyone can join or private 
tables where users must be invited. Click here for more features.
