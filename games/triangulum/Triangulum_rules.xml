This is a DTD description of a rules file.  However, since NanoXML that JOGRE
uses doesn't support DTD descriptions, it is given in a comment.

<!DOCTYPE rules [
<!ELEMENT rules (section+)>
<!ATTLIST rules content (text | text/html | text/rtf) "text"
				title CDATA #REQUIRED>
	<!ELEMENT section (section+ | CDATA)>
	<!ATTLIST title CDATA #IMPLIED>
]>

Notes: The "rules" element *must* have a title even though that title is never
       shown to the users.  If the title isn't there, then nothing will display
       in the rules window.

       Sections are not required to have a title, but only sections with titles
       will show up in the index'd tree list.

       NanoXML doesn't support mixing elements and CDATA inside of an element,
       and so non-title'd sections allow that functionality.

       You can embed sections within sections and they will show up in the
       tree as subsections.

       The <![CDATA[ ... ]]> verbiage is needed for text that uses HTML tags within
       it.  Without them, NanoXML would try to parse them as XML and fail.  For plain
       text rules files, you don't need them.

		Triangulum is based on the game Spectrangle that was invented by
		Alan John Fraser-Dackers, Maxwell Graham Gordon and
		Lester Wynne Jordan in 1989.<br><br>
		The physical board game Spectrangle is published by Jumbo Games (http://www.jumbo.eu/)
		and Educational Insights (http://www.educationalinsights.com/).<br>
		A web site with more information on Spectrangle is available at
		http://www.spectrangle.com/<br><br>
		The trash can icon was drawn by Andy Fitzsimon.  It is in the public domain
		and is available from http://www.openclipart.org/<br>
		All other graphics drawn by Richard Walter and are put into the public
		domain.<br><br>
		The program was written by Richard Walter (rwalter42@yahoo.com).

		Triangulum is played on a triangular board made up of triangular spaces.
		There are two board sizes available.  The smaller one is made up of 36
		spaces, the larger 60.<br><br>
		The pieces are triangular tiles whose edges are painted different
		colors and have a basic value displayed in the middle.  In the 36-piece
		game, there are six colors used; in the 60-piece game, there are seven
		colors used.

		At the start of the game all of the tiles to be used are mixed together
		in a bag, and each player draws a hand of tiles.  In the 36-piece
		game each player gets 4 tiles.  In the 60-piece game, each player gets
		5 tiles.<br><br>
		On a player's turn, he must place one of his tiles on an empty triangle
		space on the board.  It must be placed such that it lies next to at least
		one tile already on the board and it must be placed such that it matches
		colors with all tiles next to it.  The white color is "wild" and will
		match with any other color side.<br><br>
		On the first turn of the game there are no other tiles to place a tile
		next to.  In this case, the first player may place his first tile on any
		space of the board that does not have a bonus multiplier on it.<br><br>
		The player scores points equal to the product of the basic value of the
		tile (the number printed on it), the number of tiles adjacent to the
		played tile, and the multipler displayed on the board.  For example,
		if a player places a tile with a value of 4 on a "x2" space on the board
		and it is next to only 1 other tile, then the player would score
		4 x 2 x 1 = 8 points.<br><br>
		After playing a tile, the player draws a replacement tile from the pool.<br><br>
		If a player cannot legally play any of his tiles, then he must instead
		discard one tile and draw a replacement tile.  The discarded tile is
		removed from the game.<br><br>
		The game ends when no players have legal moves and there are no more tiles
		in the bag to be drawn.<br><br>
		The player with the highest score is the winner.

		In the middle of the screen is the board that tiles are played on.
		On the left side are the player scores and on the right side are the
		tiles in each player's hand.  Your score & tiles are always at the top,
		with the other players being shown in turn order going down.<br><br>
		On your turn, you first select one of the tiles in your hand that you
		wish to play and then you choose a location & orientation on the board
		to place the piece.<br><br>
		When moving the mouse over the tiles in your hand, if a tile is playable
		somewhere on the board, then it will show a green outline and allow you
		to click it.  If a tile is not playable anywhere on the board, then it
		will show a red outline and you won't be able to click on it.  Clicking
		on a valid tile will select it for placement on the board.<br><br>
		When moving the mouse over the main board, the game will try to place
		the currently selected tile.  If the tile can not be placed on a space
		on the board, then the space will be outlined in red.  If the tile can
		be placed, then it will be outlined in green.<br><br>
		If there are multiple valid orientations for a tile on a given space,
		then the piece will be shown in one of them and little icons will be
		shown around the piece.  Moving the mouse over one of the small icons
		will change the orientation of the big piece to that orientation.<br><br>
		Clicking the mouse on the main board will place the current tile on the
		space in the current orientation shown.  Your score will be updated with
		the points earned for that move and a new tile will be drawn from the
		bag and given to you.<br><br>
		If you have no valid moves, then you must discard a tile from your hand.
		In this case, mousing over the tiles in your hand will show a little
		trash can icon, indicating that selection of the tile will discard it.
		Clicking on a tile will discard that tile and draw a replacement from
		the bag and end your turn.
