                       Rules for the game of Octagons
					   ==============================

This program implements the game of Octagons.

It runs under the JOGRE (Java Online Gaming Real-time Engine) system.
See http://jogre.sourceforge.net

The game of Octagons is described in the book "New Rules for Classic Games" by
R. Wayne Schmittberger.

The program was written by Richard Walter (rwalter42@yahoo.com)


Players
=======
Octagons is a two player game.  One player is RED and the other is BLUE.


Goal
====
The goal of octagons is to connect two sides of the board by claiming spaces on
the board.

The RED player is trying to connect the top and bottom of the board.
The BLUE player is trying to connect the left and right sides of the board.


Board
=====
The board is a 6x6 array of octagons with each octagon split in half.
Some of the octagons are split horizontally and some are split vertically.
In between the octagons are squares.
The top and bottom edges of the board are colored RED.
The left and right edges of the board are colored BLUE.


Starting
========
The RED player always goes first.

However, the game implements the "pie rule".  After the RED player has made
his first move, the BLUE player may choose to take RED's move as his own.

(The "pie rule" comes from the method to fairly divide a pie between two
people.  The first person cuts the pie and the second chooses which half
he wants.)

Moves
=====
On a player's turn he can either claim:
    a) ONE half-octagon
 or b) TWO squares


Game Over
=========
The game ends when a player has claimed spaces the result in a continuous
path that connects his two sides of the board to each other.


Interface Details
=================
Areas on the board are colored to show ownership.  Spaces not yet claimed are
light grey.

When it is your turn, moving the mouse over a legal space on the board will
outline the space in yellow.  Clicking on a space will claim it.  If you claim
a half-octagon space, then your turn is over.  If you claim a square, then it
will stay your turn, but you can only select another square.

The last move made will be outlined in green.

If BLUE wishes to exercise the "pie rule", then on his first turn he can
select the same space that RED did.  This will convert the space to blue and
end BLUE's turn.  (If RED had selected two squares for the first move of the
game, then BLUE must select both of those squares also.  After selecting the
first square, the only valid move will be selecting the other square.)
