This file describes the initial layouts available to the client when starting
a new game.

Any client can add additional layouts to this file locally to create additional
short-cuts to initial layouts.

There is no need for the server or the other clients to have the same layouts;
whenever a new game is started the client that starts it will provide the layout
to the server which will, in turn, provide it to the other clients as they
connect.

This file is never written by the program.

title is displayed during the new game dialog.
locations provides the place where each of the fences is located on the board.
A negative number indicates the height of the fence and the following positive
numbers are the spaces on the board where that height fence should be placed.
A height of -6 is used to place a water jump.

Alternatively, locations can be the track code provided by the program.
