This is a DTD description of a rules file.  However, since NanoXML that JOGRE
uses doesn't support DTD descriptions, it is given in a comment.

<!DOCTYPE rules [
<!ELEMENT rules (section+)>
<!ATTLIST rules content (text | text/html | text/rtf) "text"
				title CDATA #REQUIRED>
	<!ELEMENT section (section+ | CDATA)>
	<!ATTLIST title CDATA #IMPLIED>
]>

Notes: The "rules" element *must* have a title even though that title is never
       shown to the users.  If the title isn't there, then nothing will display
       in the rules window.

       Sections are not required to have a title, but only sections with titles
       will show up in the index'd tree list.

       NanoXML doesn't support mixing elements and CDATA inside of an element,
       and so non-title'd sections allow that functionality.

       You can embed sections within sections and they will show up in the
       tree as subsections.

       The <![CDATA[ ... ]]> verbiage is needed for text that uses HTML tags within
       it.  Without them, NanoXML would try to parse them as XML and fail.  For plain
       text rules files, you don't need them.

		The game Hex is a connection game played on a board of hexagons.  Two
		players take turn claiming board spaces.  The winner is the first person
		to complete a path of connected hexagons between his sides of the board.<br><br>
		The "pie-rule" is implemented.  This means that after the first player has
		made his first move, the second player can choose to take the first player's
		move as his own.

			On the second player's first turn, he can invoke the "pie-rule" by
			selecting the space that the first player took on his first turn.
			In this case, rather than switching colors, the game will remove
			the first player's move and place the second player's play in the
			mirror image position.<br>]]>
