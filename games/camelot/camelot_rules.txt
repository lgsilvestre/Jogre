Players
=======
Camelot is a two player game.  One player is RED and the other is BLUE.


Goal
====
There are three ways to win Camelot.
A) A player wins if he captures all of the opponent's pieces and still has
   at least 2 pieces of his own on the board.
B) A player wins if he gets two of his pieces into the opponent's castle.
C) A player wins if his opponent has no move left.

If both players are reduced to 1 piece, then the game is a tie.


Board
=====
The board is a 12x16 array of squares with some of the square removed.
The two squares at the top of the board are the BLUE player's castle.
The two squares at the bottom of the boar are the RED player's castle.


Pieces
======
There are two types of pieces: Men and Knights.  Each player starts the
game with 10 men and 4 knights.


Moves
=====
There are four types of moves:
    1) Walk - A man or knight may move to an adjacent square horizontally,
              vertically, or diagonally.
    2) Jump - A man or knight may jump over a friendly piece and land on
              an empty square.  The friendly piece jumped over is *NOT*
              removed from the board.  Jumps can be made horizontally, vertically,
              or diagonally.  A piece may make as many jumps in one turn
              as it is possible to do, but is not forced to jump farther than
              the player wishes.  Each jump of a move may change direction.
    3) Capture - A man or knight man jump over an opponent's piece and land
              on an empty square.  The piece jump over is *IMMEDIATELY* removed
              from the board.  Captures can be made horizontally, vertically,
              or diagonally.  After jumping, if the piece lands such that it
              can make another capture, then it must continue to capture.
              Each capture of a move may change direction.
    4) Knight's Charge - A knight may combine jumps and captures.  In this
              case, zero or more jumps are done followed by zreo or more captures.
              Once a knight has captured a piece, it cannot go back to jumps
              again.

If a player can make a capture, then he must capture.
If a player has a choice of captures, then he can choose which one to make.
A knight's move only changes from a jump to a Knight's charge when the knight
lands in a position where it is possible to make a capture.  A knight may stop
a jumping move up to that point, but once it reaches a square where it can
capture, it must either take that capture, or continue jumping to a point where
it can make other capture.

A player cannot move or jump into his own castle.
A player may make capture that results in his piece landing in his castle.  In
this case, the player *MUST* move the piece out of his castle on his next turn.
This overrides the requirement to make a capture.

Once a piece has been moved into the opponent's castle, it cannot leave the
castle for any reason.  It is possible for a piece to walk from one square of
the castle to the other square of the castle.  This is called a "Castle Move".
Each player, however, may only make 2 castle moves each game.


Interface Details
=================
When it is your turn, moving the mouse over a piece that can move will outline
the piece in yellow.  If a piece does not highlight that means that that piece
cannot move.  (This is usually because there is another piece that you can use
to make a capture and this one can't make a capture.)

Clicking on a piece will select it for moving.  All of the spaces that the
selected piece can legally reach will be outlined in green.

Clicking on a different piece will unselect the currently selected piece and
select the new one.

Moving the mouse over a green square will show the path that the selected piece
takes to get from its current square to the chosen ending square.

In the case of captures, there may be multiple paths for a piece from its
starting square to the ending square.  By moving the mouse out of the green
square and back in again, an alternate path will be shown.  By repeatedly moving
out and back in, you can cycle around all possible moves.

Clicking on a green square will make the move that is currently shown.

When your opponent makes a move, his selected path is shown before the pieces are
actually moved, to allow you to see his complete move.  Clicking in the window will
cause the move to take effect before showing your legal moves.
